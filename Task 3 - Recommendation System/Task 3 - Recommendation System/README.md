# Task 3 - Bollywood + Hollywood Movie Recommendation System 🎬🇮🇳

This is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python.  
It uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to recommend similar movies based on a given input.

This version includes a mix of popular Bollywood and Hollywood movies.

## 👩‍💻 Project by: *Vanshika Srivastava*

As part of the **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship – Task 3**, this project was developed from scratch to understand how recommendation systems work using content filtering and vector similarity.

---

## 💡 Features:
- Suggests top 3 movies similar to a given input title
- Uses both Bollywood & Hollywood movies
- TF-IDF vectorizer converts text into numerical values
- Cosine similarity compares movie descriptions
- Console-based interaction for easy testing

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (`TfidfVectorizer`, `cosine_similarity`)

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run:
1. Save the code in a file named `movie_recommender.py`
2. Make sure the required libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python movie_recommender.py
```

4. Enter any movie title from the list like:
`3 Idiots`, `Inception`, `Dangal`, `PK`, `Barfi`, `Tenet`, `Queen`, etc.
